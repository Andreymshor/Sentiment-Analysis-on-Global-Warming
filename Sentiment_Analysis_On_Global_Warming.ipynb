Anything below -.02 was classified as a negative opinion tweet and everything above .02 was classified as positive opinion tweet. I also used the WordCloud library to determine how the sentiments were distributed. The subjectivity score was used later, and it ranges from [0,1], with 1 being heavily opinionated and 0 was being completely factual. The most common words were:\n",

I then printed out the postive tweets, negative tweets, and neutral tweets in order to see what was classified as a positive tweet, a negative tweet, and a neutral tweet. This is where I started to encounter problems as it was very difficult to understand how the polarity was distributed among the tweets. The built in TextBlob method seemed to have a really difficult time distinguishing between sarcasm and genuine concern. One way to fix this would be to provide my own data set of positive and negative tweets and train the classifer on that instead of using TextBlog's built in dataset (which is what I am doing now).  There were tweets that should have been classified as positive and instead were classified as neutral or negative, and visa versa. This issue may therefore make the conclusion biased and not fully representative of the entire population of Twitter.\n",

        "After analyzing the data, the conclusion I have made is that the sentiment analysis is most likely wrong. This is because I have used the built in TextBlob methods without providing a training set of my own. Because of this, polarity and subjectivity are getting determined incorrectly, and therefore making any conclusion off of this would probably result in incorrect inferences about people's opinions on Twitter in regards to Global Warming. \n",

        "TextBlob's methods are trained on a generic dataset and therefore may provide incorrect information conclusion on specific tweets. The next step in this project for me would be to train my own classifer using Textblob and see if it can potentially interpret these tweets better. Afterwards, I would like to do a prediction test and see if my classifer can classify a tweet which it has not seen before correctly.\n"
